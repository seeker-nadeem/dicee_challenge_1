# dicee_challenge_1

This is a basic Dice Challenge created using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and DOM. I made this for practice while learning these skills.

Instructions: Refresh your browser repeatedly to change the result. With each refresh, the numbers on the dice will change. The player with the dice and the highest number will be the winner. If the results are the same, it will be declared a tie. Have fun with it!
